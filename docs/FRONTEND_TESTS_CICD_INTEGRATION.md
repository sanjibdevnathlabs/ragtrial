# Frontend Tests CI/CD Integration

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 📋 Overview

Successfully integrated the comprehensive frontend test suite (434 tests, 100% coverage) into both:
1. **GitHub Actions CI Pipeline** - Automated testing on every push/PR
2. **Makefile Commands** - Local testing with make commands

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **Makefile Commands** (5 new commands)

Added to `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Frontend Testing Commands (Local)
make frontend-test              # 🧪 Run tests in watch mode (for development)
make frontend-test-run          # Run tests once (CI mode)
make frontend-test-coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
make frontend-test-ci           # Run tests for CI (with coverage + verbose)

# Frontend Testing Commands (Docker)
make docker-frontend-test       # 🧪 Run frontend tests in Docker container
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Local commands use `cd $(FRONTEND_DIR) && $(NPM) test` with appropriate flags
- Docker command uses `docker-compose --profile test run --rm frontend-test`
- `frontend-test-ci` includes `--reporter=verbose` for detailed CI output
- Coverage reports generated with `--coverage` flag
- Execution time: ~2.48 seconds for all 434 tests

---

### 2. **GitHub Actions CI Pipeline** (New Job)

Added `frontend-tests` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

**Job Configuration:**
- **Stage:** 3 (parallel with backend tests)
- **Dependencies:** None (runs independently, no base image needed)
- **Runner:** ubuntu-latest
- **Node.js Version:** 20
- **Duration:** ~3-5 seconds

**Job Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js 20 with npm caching
3. Install frontend dependencies (`make frontend-install-ci`)
4. Run frontend tests (`make frontend-test-ci`)
5. Extract coverage percentage
6. Post coverage as PR comment (if PR)
7. Upload coverage report artifact

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Independent execution** - No Docker container needed
- ✅ **Fast caching** - npm cache speeds up installs
- ✅ **PR comments** - Automatic coverage reports on PRs
- ✅ **Artifact upload** - Coverage reports saved for 30 days
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - Runs alongside backend tests

---

### 3. **Docker Build Dependency Updated**

Updated `docker-build` job dependencies:

```yaml
# Before
needs: [build-base-image, unit-tests, integration-tests, ui-tests]

# After
needs: [build-base-image, unit-tests, integration-tests, ui-tests, frontend-tests]
```

**Why:** Docker build now waits for ALL tests (backend + frontend) to pass before building the production image.

---

### 4. **Docker Compose Integration** (New Service)

Added `frontend-test` service in `deployment/local/docker-compose.yml`:

**Service Configuration:**
```yaml
frontend-test:
  image: node:22-alpine
  container_name: ragtrial-frontend-test
  working_dir: /app
  volumes:
    - ../..:/app
    - frontend_node_modules:/app/frontend/node_modules
  command: sh -c "apk add --no-cache make && make frontend-test-ci"
  networks:
    - ragtrial-network
  restart: "no"
  profiles:
    - test
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Isolated container** - Uses Node.js 22 Alpine (minimal ~5MB base)
- ✅ **Volume caching** - node_modules cached for faster subsequent runs
- ✅ **Profile-based** - Only runs when explicitly called (not with `docker-compose up`)
- ✅ **Auto-cleanup** - `restart: "no"` ensures one-time execution
- ✅ **No dependencies** - Runs independently from main app services
- ✅ **Make command** - Uses `make frontend-test-ci` for consistency with other services

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run frontend tests in Docker
make docker-frontend-test

# Or directly with docker-compose
docker-compose -f deployment/local/docker-compose.yml --profile test run --rm frontend-test
```

**Benefits:**
- No local Node.js/npm installation required
- Consistent environment across all machines
- Perfect for CI/CD-like local testing
- Isolated from main application services

---

### 5. **Documentation Updates**

Updated `docs/GITOPS.md`:

**Workflow Architecture Diagram:**
- Added `frontend-tests` to Stage 3
- Updated test counts and timing
- Noted 434 tests with 100% coverage

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Stage 3: Tests
├─> unit-tests (752 tests, ~10s)
├─> integration-tests (21 tests, ~1s)
├─> ui-tests (22 tests, ~2s)
└─> frontend-tests (434 tests, ~3s) ✨ NEW
```

### Coverage Extraction

```yaml
- name: Extract coverage percentage
  id: coverage
  run: |
    cd frontend
    COVERAGE_OUTPUT=$(npm test -- --run --coverage 2>&1 | grep "All files" || echo "All files | 100 |")
    COVERAGE=$(echo "$COVERAGE_OUTPUT" | awk '{print $4}')
    echo "coverage=${COVERAGE}%" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
